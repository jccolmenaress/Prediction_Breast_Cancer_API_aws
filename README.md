# Prediction_Breast_Cancer_API_aws
This Api predicts the breast Cancer using a regression model.
This API is deployed on AWS using the Sagemaker, S3, Lambda and API Gateway services.
For cost reasons  I don't share the link of this  API, but I do share the notebook where is the preprocessing of the data, the model and the creation of the endpoint,  wich allows the connection with the serverless lambda.
